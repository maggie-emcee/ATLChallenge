A simple chat web application for Allied Telesis Labs Inc. Coding Challenge.

This is the entry for candidate, Maggie M. Cadwising.

No build tools such as maven or ant was used in this project. 
I figured it would be mush simpler and easier to execute without the need for other tools, in case testers don't have any of those said tools.

To compile & run, simply IMPORT as an existing project with Eclipse JEE (or any IDE you're comfortable with) and run on any server. This project is tested with Apache Tomcat.

Should you need to create a war build, simply export project as War using Eclipse's (or your IDE's) built in export function.
